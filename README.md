# Hydrodynamic Analysis of a Ship Hull using Ansys Fluent (VOF Model) 🚢


## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs a three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation on a ship hull to analyze its resistance and wake characteristics in water. The simulation utilizes the **Volume of Fluid (VOF)** model to accurately capture the complex free-surface interaction and wave formation around the hull, which is critical for calculating effective drag and optimizing hull design.

## ⚙️ Simulation Setup and Methodology

### 1. Geometry and Mesh
* **Object Analyzed:** Ship Hull (Hydrodynamic Body).
* **Computational Domain:** A domain optimized to model the water surface and flow around the hull.
* **Mesh Statistics:**
    * **Cells:** 865,239
    * **Faces:** 1,767,884
    * **Nodes:** 163,572
    * *The mesh density is sufficient to resolve complex flow features and the free surface.*

### 2. Solver Settings
* **Solver Type:** Pressure-Based, Steady-State (or transient for wave evolution).
* **Models:**
    * **Volume of Fluid (VOF):** Used for tracking the interface between two immiscible fluids (Air and Water).
    * **Turbulence Model:** **SST k-omega** model, chosen for its accuracy and robust performance in modeling boundary layers, flow separation, and hydrodynamic applications.
* **Materials:** Two phases are defined: Water (Phase 2) and Air (Phase 1).

### 3. Boundary Conditions
The simulation environment replicates towing tank conditions:
* **Inlet:** Velocity or Mass Flow Inlet (specifying the ship's speed).
* **Outlet:** Pressure Outlet.
* **Free Surface:** Defined by VOF interface tracking.
* **Hull Surface:** No-slip wall condition.

## 📊 Results & Analysis

### 🔍 Key Findings (Inferred from Report Structure)
1.  **Wave Profile:** The VOF model successfully captured the wave patterns generated by the hull, including the bow and stern waves. 
2.  **Resistance Calculation (fd):** The report definition `report-def-0` calculated a total resistance value of **14330.4 N**.
3.  **Flow Characteristics:** Velocity contours show the movement of water around the hull and into the propeller plane, which is critical for propulsion design.
4.  **Convergence Status:** The simulation ran for 378 iterations. While most velocity and VOF residuals converged, the **continuity** and **k** residuals were flagged as 'Not Converged' to the absolute criteria (0.001), indicating the possibility for further iteration or stricter criteria.
